# prometheus-bindrndc_textfile
When I found out that prometheus bind_exporter did support tcp clients i decided to make a small script to gather metrics from rndc (as suggested by)[https://github.com/prometheus-community/bind_exporter/issues/189] [dswarbrick](https://github.com/dswarbrick)

This is the result.
